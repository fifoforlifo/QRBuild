BuildTranslation.Execute() implementations should follow these conventions:
-   Write a response file (if the executable supports it).
-   Write a shell script that does the following:
    -   create the right environment
    -   change directory to the right working directory
    -   call the build tools, and pipe stdout/stderr to a file
    Such a shell script would be executable from the (temp) directory
    where it would reside.  Users can run these scripts at any time
    for debug purposes.
-   The output log files can be displayed, or reconstructed into a
    unified log in post-processing.
