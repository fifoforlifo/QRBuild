Goals:
-   Allow simple command-line build of a module.
-   Make it easy to define simple projects.
-   Make inter-project dependencies easy.
-   Allow user definition of the build variant.
-   Allow projects to support custom commands.
-   Provide full help.
-   Everything should be strongly typed.
-   Enable easy definition of a bootstrap pattern.


Implementation Ideas:
-   BuildVariant should be user-defined and strongly typed.
    -   May require dynamic method generation to invoke a user's
        method that takes their specific type as a parameter.
    -   Alternatively, could use source-generation tricks.
        This is less desirable from the standpoint of usability from
        any project implementation.
-   Concept of a "variant string", which is a user-friendly
    serialized form of a BuildVariant.
    -   Each field of a BuildVariant has an ordinal position.
    -   Variant string contains the variant's values, delimited by dots.
    -   Example: x86.debug, x64.release, develop.x86.gcc
    -   Can use reflection to have a generic handling of this.
-   Each project should only be instanced once per variant, so that
    the same translation's are not repeatedly added to the BuildGraph.
